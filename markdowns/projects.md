>The Corruptor
>>Working with ASRC Federal, this project is an in-house product that takes incoming message data and modifies it to generate hard to create scenarios.A GUI (Graphical User Interface) is needed to create custom tests on the fly. This GUI will assist engineers in testing scenarios that would normally require a full recompile or build of the program.
The team will design and develop a GUI that creates custom “Tests” using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. These tests will be persisted to a text file, preferably XML, JSON, etc. (must be a format that a C++ application can read and process). Applicable tools are Java 8, Python, or C++11 for front/backend coding. At the end of the semester the sponsors would like a working demonstration that provides a way to create XML, JSON, etc files dynamically to be imported by a C++ driver. The C++ driver will be provided.

>GME Matchmaking Application
>>GME is a musical matchmaking web application, whose primary objective is to bring together people who have similar musical tastes in order to enhance their musical libraries. The website will allow guest users to listen to snippets of music and based on their taste to music and will build a profile based on genre and favorite songs. If a user is to login through Spotify this profile information is gathered through the API. Either way, this profile is stored on a database that then be traversed and matched against similarly minded individuals and bring them up as a potential “listening-mate”. The “listening-mates” can then be joined together in a listening party (genre based) with further chat options to exchange through messaging or email.
